# ScreenCapture
 Simple screen capture application

One more just-for-fun freelance project (https://www.freelancer.com/projects/dot-net/Windows-Application-Developer/details).

What does it do? Nothing special. it simple captures screen(s) with the specified interval and saves it (or them, if you have more than 1 monitor) into specified folder. That's all. Easy. And funny.

.NET Framework 4, Visual Studio 2019, C#.
